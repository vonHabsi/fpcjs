Unlike original/official Delphi JavaScript bridge, which is due to its complexness not compileable in FPC (FreePascal) and/or doesn't work really well, is too big, bloated and outdated, this project use only js15decl.pas (basically C header) interface from the original bridge and add very small (simple and maintainable) wrapper around it to simplify the usage of Mozilla JavaScript engine in FPC. It also contain set of minimal working demos how to do basic JS stuff from FPC like call JS function, set JS variable, call FPC function from JS, etc... Please use SVN to download the project.
